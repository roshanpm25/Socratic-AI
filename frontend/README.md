# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.

# add instructions to the students or give predefined words like i dont understand thanks not clear

Dynamic Difficulty: The tutor recognizes when the child is getting a concept right. It would then automatically increase the difficulty of the next question, ensuring the child is always challenged but not frustrated.

Targeted Feedback: If the child consistently makes the same type of mistake (e.g., always adding the denominator), the tutor can pause and focus on that specific concept until it is mastered.

That's an excellent and very important question. Asking for the student's age upfront has both benefits and significant risks. While it might seem like a straightforward way to tailor the experience, it opens up a number of ethical and legal issues, especially when dealing with children.

The Case Against Asking for Age
For a public-facing application, directly asking for a child's age or other personal information (like a name) is a legal and ethical landmine.

Privacy Laws: In the United States, the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) is a major legal framework that requires developers to get verifiable parental consent before collecting personal data from children under 13. This process is complex and often involves sending a consent form to a parent or having them verify their identity through a credit card or government ID, which is a huge barrier for a small project.


Privacy and Trust: Even if you're not in the US, it's an ethical best practice to avoid collecting personal information from children. Parents are very protective of their children's data, and asking for it upfront can immediately cause them to distrust your app.

A Better, Safer Alternative
Instead of directly asking for a student's age, you can use a Socratic approach to implicitly determine their skill level. This is the best way to tailor the experience without collecting sensitive information.

Here's how you can do it:

Start with a broad, introductory question: Your app's first question could be a simple one that's easy for most kids to answer, like, "Hi! Let's start with a puzzle. What is 5 + 3?"

Adapt based on the answer:

If the child answers correctly, you can move on to slightly more advanced topics, like "Now, what is 10 + 15?"

If the child struggles, the app can provide a hint and then offer a simpler problem to build their confidence.That's an excellent and very important question.
